            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation"> disruptive technology</a> is changing the
            way we live our daily lives. Nava Tech recognize that running a small or medium business like Food industry,
            Fitness and Nutrition service, E-Commerce, Professional service are challenging and it will take all your
            time and energy. The big businesses like Nike or Oreo cookies have ample financial resources to take
            advantage of the current
            digital marketing trends. In addition, the big businesses are ready and willing to take a financial
            risk and are ready to fail and apply what they have learned. However, small and medium businesses
            do not have adequate financial resources or the time to catch up to the current digital marketing trends.
            Furthermore, it is very challenging to learn all of the technology trends and to keep the small and medium
            businesses running efficiently. Hence, we strongly feel that NAVA TECH can help the small and medium
            businesses learn to stay current and relevant by taking advantage of an open source culture and embracing
            teamwork to grow their business in this digital world. </p>
          <p class="process-text">

            and
            learn from your experience. When you partner with us, we will educate you on our digital marketing S3(scube)
            process and we will take the time to learn about your vision for your product or service. We recognize that
            every business is different and has their own unique needs, which is why every social media post, blog,
            video sharing (what type of video sharing?) and digital marketing strategy we implement,
            will be personalized to meet the specific needs of your audience.
          </p>
